# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
#
# List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

# Create a List:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

# Lists allow duplicate values:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

# Print the number of items in the list:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))

# String, int and boolean data types:
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]

# A list with strings, integers and boolean values:
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]

# What is the data type of a list?
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(mylist))

# Using the list() constructor to make a List:
thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist)

# NO PLEASE NO
